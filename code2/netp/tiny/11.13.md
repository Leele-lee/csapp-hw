When you modify **Tiny** to handle `SIGPIPE` signals and `EPIPE` errors, the goal is to make the server robust and avoid termination when attempting to write to a closed connection. The server will catch the `SIGPIPE` signal (which is sent when a process tries to write to a socket that has been closed by the peer) and handle it gracefully instead of exiting.

### Analysis:

- **SIGPIPE** is sent to a process when it attempts to write to a socket that has been closed by the remote side (client). By default, the process terminates when it receives a `SIGPIPE` signal.
  
- **EPIPE error**: This error can occur in the `write` or `send` system calls if the remote side has closed the connection. Normally, `write` will return `-1` and set `errno` to `EPIPE`.

- **Objective**: We need to handle these events so that Tiny doesn't terminate when a client closes the connection before the server finishes writing the response.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Handling `SIGPIPE` Signal:**
   - The signal handler should catch `SIGPIPE` and prevent the default behavior (which is terminating the process).
   - To achieve this, we can install a signal handler for `SIGPIPE` and make it ignore the signal.

2. **Handling `EPIPE` errors:**
   - Whenever you call `write()` or any similar function (like `Rio_writen()`), you need to check if the function returns `-1` and if `errno` is set to `EPIPE`. 
   - In case of `EPIPE`, you can handle the error gracefully (e.g., logging it) without terminating the server.

### **Step-by-Step Modifications:**

#### Step 1: Install a Signal Handler for `SIGPIPE`

The `SIGPIPE` signal needs to be ignored. This can be done in the `main()` function or before the server starts handling requests. The function `signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)` tells the operating system to ignore the `SIGPIPE` signal.

```c
#include <signal.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    /* Ignore SIGPIPE signal to prevent server termination when writing to a closed socket */
    signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN);

    // Your code to start the server and handle requests
    // Example:
    // start_server();
}
```

#### Step 2: Modify `Rio_writen()` to Handle `EPIPE` Error

The function `Rio_writen` (which is a wrapper around `write()`) is used to write data to the socket. If the connection is closed prematurely (for example, the client closes the browser before the server responds), `write()` will return `-1`, and `errno` will be set to `EPIPE`.

You need to modify `Rio_writen()` to handle this error condition properly without crashing the server.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to modify `Rio_writen()`:

```c
#include <errno.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

ssize_t Rio_writen(int fd, void *buf, size_t n) {
    ssize_t nleft = n;
    ssize_t nwritten;
    char *ptr = buf;

    while (nleft > 0) {
        if ((nwritten = write(fd, ptr, nleft)) <= 0) {
            if (nwritten == 0) {
                break; // No more data to write
            }
            if (errno == EPIPE) {
                // Client closed the connection prematurely, handle gracefully
                fprintf(stderr, "EPIPE error: connection closed by client.\n");
                return -1; // You can log and return -1 or handle the error as needed
            }
            if (errno == EINTR) {
                // Retry if interrupted by signal
                nwritten = 0;
            } else {
                return -1;  // Other errors, return failure
            }
        }
        nleft -= nwritten;
        ptr += nwritten;
    }
    return n - nleft;
}
```

This ensures that the server doesn't terminate when it attempts to write to a closed connection.

---

### Step 3: Adjust the Server's Response Code

Ensure that the server doesn't crash when writing to closed connections. In the part of your Tiny server where it handles the HTTP response, add checks for any write failures (as seen in the modified `Rio_writen`).

For example, modify the part of the code where the response is sent:

```c
ssize_t n = Rio_writen(fd, buf, strlen(buf));
if (n < 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error writing to socket\n");
    return;  // Handle the error and return gracefully, no need to crash the server
}
```

---

### **Step 4: Test the Server**

Now, test the server in various scenarios:
- **Close the connection** from the client side (e.g., close the browser window before receiving a response).
- **Observe the server behavior**: The server should continue to run and handle other requests without crashing. It should log the `EPIPE` error when trying to write to the closed connection, but it won't terminate.

---

### **Summary of Changes**

1. **Signal Handling**:
   - Install a handler for `SIGPIPE` to ignore the signal and prevent the server from terminating when a client closes the connection prematurely.

2. **Error Handling in `write()`**:
   - Modify the `Rio_writen()` function to catch the `EPIPE` error and handle it gracefully instead of terminating the process.

3. **Graceful Shutdown**:
   - Ensure that the server doesn't crash when trying to write to a closed connection and logs the error instead.
