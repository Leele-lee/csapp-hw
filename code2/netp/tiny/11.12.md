## BASIC CONCPET

Extend TINY so that it servesdynamiccontentrequested bythe HTTP POST method. Checkyourworkusing yourfavorite Web browser.

> `POST` method:
The POST method is used by web clients (like browsers) to send data to the server in the body of the HTTP request. And GET method is through URI in request line.

## THREAD

To handle POST method, we should:

1. **check the HTTP request method**: Modify the TINY server to check if the HTTP request is a POST request.

    ```c
        if ((strcasecmp(method, "GET") != 0) && (strcasecmp (method, "POST") != 0)) { // line:netp:doit:beginrequesterr
            clienterror(fd, method, "501", "Not Implemented",
                    "Tiny does not implement this method");
            return;
        } // line:netp:doit:endrequesterr

    ```

2. **Read the post data**: For POST requests, the data will be sent in the body of the request, not in the URL like GET requests. You need to read this data. In GET method we using `read_requesthdrs` function to direct ignore request header, now we need modify `read_requesthdrs` so we can read the data length in request header.

    ```c
    int read_requesthdrs(rio_t *rp, char *method)
    {
        char buf[MAXLINE];
        int len;

        do
        {
            Rio_readlineb(rp, buf, MAXLINE);
            printf("%s", buf);
            if (strcasecmp(method, "POST") == 0 && strncasecmp(buf, "Content-Length:", 15) == 0)
            {
                sscanf(buf, "Content-Length: %d", &len);
            }
        } while (strcmp(buf, "\r\n"));
        return len;
    }
    ```

3. **Process the POST data**: The data can be passed to a CGI script or handled directly by the server (e.g., to perform some operation like saving data, calculating something, etc.). In this tiny adder server, we dealt it in `doit` function instead of `server_dynamic`. First we read the paraments into buf, then we pass buf instead of cgiargs into `serve_dynamic`.

    ```c
        bodylen = read_requesthdrs(&rio, method); // line:netp:doit:readrequesthdrs
        Rio_readnb(&rio, buf, bodylen);
        if (is_static)
        { /* Serve static content */
            ...
        }
        else
        { /* Serve dynamic content */
            ...
            if (strcasecmp(method, "POST") == 0)
            {
               serve_dynamic(fd, filename, buf);
            }
            else
            {
               serve_dynamic(fd, filename, cgiargs); // line:netp:doit:servedynamic
            }
        }
    ```

4. **change html to deal with POST methos instead of GET method**

   ```c
   /*post-home.html*/
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Adder Form</title>
    </head>
    <body> 
        <h1>Simple Adder Form</h1>
        <form action="/cgi-bin/adder" method="POST">
            <label for="num1">First number:</label>
            <input type="text" name="num1" id="num1"><br><br>

            <label for="num2">Second number:</label>
            <input type="text" name="num2" id="num2"><br><br>

            <input type="submit" value="Add">
        </form>
    </body>
    </html>
   ```

## TEST

### **Test in web broser**

To test the POST functionality, you can use HTML forms with the POST method and your web browser to submit data to the TINY server.

- First recompile `tiny.11.12.c.`  

  ```c
  gcc -o tiny11.12 tiny11.12.c csapp.o -lpthread
  ```

- Start the TINY web server as usual. `./tiny11.12 20001`
- Open the HTML form in your browser and submit the form. `http://localhost:5000/post-home.html`  
    > POST method pass param by message-body behind Headers part. When we input 9 and 10 and submit, socket pass content.
- You should see the POST data sent to the server, and the server will process the data (e.g., calculating the sum of two numbers if you follow the adder example).
  
    ```c
    /* POST Request Example:*/
    POST /add HTTP/1.1  /*request line*/
    Host: localhost:20001 /*The server's hostname and port*/
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  /*This indicates that the form data is encoded as key-value pairs (like num1=10&num2=20).*/
    Content-Length: 27  /*The length of the request body, which is 27 bytes in this case (the length of the data being sent, excluding headers).*/
    Connection: close /*The length of the request body, which is 27 bytes in this case (the length of the data being sent, excluding headers).*/
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36 /*A string identifying the browser or client that made the request. This is used for browser and device detection on the server side (optional).*/

    num1=10&num2=20 /*request body*/
    ```

### **Test by using Telnet**  

If you want to simulate this POST request via Telnet, you can manually type in the request. Here's how you could do it:

1. Open a terminal and connect to your server using Telnet:
  
   ```c
   telnet localhost 20001
   ```

2. Once connected, type the following (note that you need to simulate headers and body manually):

    ```c
    POST /add HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost:20001
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Content-Length: 27
    Connection: close

    num1=10&num2=20
    ```

This will send the request to your server as a POST method with form data.
