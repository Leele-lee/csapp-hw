## where wrong?

In the original version of the server, the `check_clients` function tries to read a full line (ending with `\n`) using `Rio_readlineb`. This **blocks** if the client sends only part of a line and doesn’t end it with `\n`. This allows a malicious client to deny service to others by keeping the server stuck waiting.

## `check_clients`

```c
char buf[FD_SETSIZE][MAXLINE];   // Per-client buffer
int buf_len[FD_SETSIZE];         // Current length of buffer
```

Client connects:

1. Types "hello" and waits
2. Server reads "hello" (no \n) → buffer updated, but no echo
3. Client types "\n"
4. Now server finds full line in buffer → echoes it
5. Any remaining data is kept for next round

And in check_clients():

- Use recv(connfd, ...) or read() to non-blockingly get available bytes
- Append to the per-client buffer
- Check if any full line (\n) exists — if yes, echo that line

```c
/*
for all the satisfied connfd
    first decrement nready
    if loop for n = read > 0 first check now buffer[connfd] length > max_len?,
     if yes, stderr and close ... 
     if not, add to client buffer, and add the read bytes to buf_len according return num
     Try to find the first \n of client_buf[i](using memchr);
      if has \n, writen this part to connfd, put remainning part to the beginning of client_buf[i] using memmove, be noticed the difference between memmove and memcpy and reduce correspond buf_len;
      if not has \n, do nothing
    for read < 0,just act like before(close...)
    */
```

> **notice**: do not using readn instead of read, because we don't know how many bytes we should to read, for `Rio_readn(connfd, buf, MAXBUF_LEN);` it will block until read `MAXBUF_LEN` bytes, but for `recv(connfd, buf, MAXBUF_LEN, 0);` or `recv(connfd, buf, MAXBUF_LEN, 0);` both will read whatever is available, up to `MAXBUF_LEN`, and then return immediately — which is exactly what we want in a `select()`-based server.
