> Derive a solution to the second readers-writersproblem,which favors writers instead of readers.

## READER PART

```c
void* reader(void* arg) {
  int id = *(int*)arg;
  free(arg);

  // Entry Section
  sem_wait(&queue);            // Wait to enter the queue (writer priority)
  sem_wait(&mutex);
  if (read_count == 0)
    sem_wait(&rw_mutex);     // First reader locks the resource
  read_count++;
  sem_post(&mutex);
  sem_post(&queue);            // Allow others to line up

  // Critical Section
  printf("Reader %d is reading\n", id);
  sleep(1); // Simulate reading

  // Exit Section
  sem_wait(&mutex);
  read_count--;
  if (read_count == 0)
    sem_post(&rw_mutex);     // Last reader releases the resource
  sem_post(&mutex);

  printf("Reader %d is done reading\n", id);
  return NULL;
}
```

### Analysis

the solution's reader part is the same as the 12-20(Derive a solution that gives equal priority to readers and writers). They can both support concurrent reader come we can tell that by it let first reader locks the resource and last reader releases the resource

We unlock queue after count++ because if reader line in the queue(after come in lock queue), it almost certain that reader will be happen sooner, so we can put it after count++. If we unlock queue so quickly：

```c
sem_wait(&queue);
sem_post(&queue);       // ❌ Released too early!
sem_wait(&mutex);
// race condition here!
```

- Now multiple readers can enter before a writer gets a turn, even if a writer was already waiting.

- This would violate writer priority — readers can sneak in before being counted, starving the writer. 

| Mistake                            | Consequence                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Releasing `queue` too early        | Allows other threads to enter **before you're ready** |
| Reader not fully counted yet       | Writers don't see them — causes race or priority bugs |
| Writer may grab `rw_mutex` first   | Reader will get blocked or crash logic                |
| Multiple readers sneak past writer | **Writers starve**, and **priority is broken**        |


In short, reader's queue including this

```c
  sem_wait(&queue);            // Wait to enter the queue (writer priority)
  sem_wait(&mutex);
  if (read_count == 0)
    sem_wait(&rw_mutex);     // First reader locks the resource
  read_count++;
  sem_post(&mutex);
  sem_post(&queue);            // Allow others to line up
```

Because this can also prevent the race from the writer(this race happenning on rw_mutex), if reader queue unlock before get rw_mutex, then writer would race for it.

> **So queue guaranteed the time from queue'lock to queue'unlock, all operations happens between that can not be interuptted by other reader/writer(for reader is rw_mutex, for writer are point to rw_mutex and inclusively write to critical section)**

## WRITER PART

```c
void* writer(void* arg) {
  int id = *(int*)arg;
  free(arg);

  // Entry Section
  sem_wait(&mutex);
  write_wait++;               // Writer announces intention to write
  sem_post(&mutex);

  sem_wait(&queue);           // Wait in line (blocks future readers)
  sem_wait(&rw_mutex);        // Exclusive access to resource

  // Critical Section
  printf("Writer %d is writing\n", id);
  sleep(2); // Simulate writing

  // Exit Section
  sem_post(&rw_mutex);        // Release resource
  sem_post(&queue);           // Allow next in line

  sem_wait(&mutex);
  write_wait--;               // Writer done
  sem_post(&mutex);

  printf("Writer %d is done writing\n", id);
  return NULL;
}
```

This part compared to equal priority has little changed,
this is writer part for equal priority:

```c
    sem_wait(&queue);        // Wait turn
    sem_wait(&rw_mutex); // Lock resource
    sem_post(&queue);        // Allow next thread

    // Writing section
    printf("Writer %d is writing\n", id);
    sleep(1); // Simulate writing

    sem_post(&rw_mutex);     // Release resource
}
```

This is the reader part for writer priority:

```c
  sem_wait(&mutex);
  write_wait++;               // Writer announces intention to write
  sem_post(&mutex);
  sem_wait(&queue);           // Wait in line (blocks future readers)
  sem_wait(&rw_mutex);        // Exclusive access to resource
  // write in Critical Section
  printf("Writer %d is writing\n", id);
  sleep(2); // Simulate writing
  // Exit Section
  sem_post(&rw_mutex);        // Release resource
  sem_post(&queue);           // Allow next in line
```

we campared and can get the conclusion:

- in both version, lock rw_mutex all be included by queue(between lock and unlock for queue), because this can not be interrupted by reader/writer in case for race happenning
- for writer priority, queue contains more --- including writen in critical section, this can give next writer more time to wait in queue. if not, reader may be sneak in before current writer done, So no reader can sneak in during its writing phase.
- In short, Holding queue blocks everyone else — both readers and writers — until the writer is done writing
